            A day without the Internet, social media or even electricity is impossible 
            to imagine for us. As we are habituated to these things and more or less they 
            have become a necessity rather than just being a time pass.
        </p>
  
        <p>
            Now, you will be thinking about how is this even related to this page. 
            So, these things are the outcome of various technologies and techniques and one among them is Full Stack Web Development.

            It refers to the development of both front end(client side) and back end(server side) portions of web application.
        </p>

        <p>
            Full stack web developers have the ability to design complete web applications and websites. 
            They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of web applications or websites.

        <h3>
            HTML/CSS
        </h3>
  
        <p>
            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language aid the developer in structuring 
            the web page with the deployment of markup. 
            CSS refers to Cascading Style sheets acts as a building block in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            In HTML, the latest version is HTML5 and CSS3 is the current version in CSS. 
            HTML5 and CSS3 lend a helping hand in styling the content along with the decoration part of the website.
        </p>
            <ul><li><pre><code>
            /*This is CSS code*/
            body {
                background-color: lightblue;
              }
              
            h1 {
                color: white;
                text-align: center;
              }
              
            p {
                font-family: verdana;
                font-size: 20px;
              }</code></pre></li></ul>

        <h3>
            JavaScript
        </h3>
        <p>
            When we talk about object scripting languages, JavaScript tops the list due to its contribution 
            to the addition of behaviors with the help of HTML. It's uniqueness lies in the deployment of this language's 
            execution over the native browser along with the usage over server-side.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript has numerous frameworks namely Angular.js and React.js that the developer must be aware of.
            Moreover, this offers admirable features like prototypes, closure in making responsive web pages, functions, 
            along with higher-order event delegation.
        </p>
        <ul><li><pre><code>
            //This is JavaScript Code 
            var x, y, z;
            x = 5;    
            y = 6;   
            z = x + y;  
            
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
            "The value of z is " + z + ".";
            </code></pre></li></ul>

        <h3>
            Angular.js        
        </h3>
  
        <p>
            It is among the open-source framework for web application to create RIA (Rich Internet Application). 
            It is chosen for writing coding that is not restricted to any specific platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides, it is good at handling JavaScript code suitable for browser individually. 
            It's major contribution can be witnessed in single phase application along with line of business application.
        </p>

        <h3>
            React JS
        </h3>
        <p>
            This technique is deployed for the construction of reusable User Interface components.
             It is preferred due to the declarative and flexible nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, this offers admirable features like prototypes, closure in making responsive web pages, functions, 
            along with higher-order event delegation.
        </p>
        <ul><li><pre><code>
            import React from 'react';
            import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

            function Hello(props) {
                return &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;;
            }

            ReactDOM.render(&lt;Hello /&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));
        </code></pre></li></ul>

        <h3>Database & Cache</h3>
        <p>
            It is vital for every Full Stack developer to have the knowledge in Database and Cache. 
            Some of the well-known databases deployed for this purpose are Oracle, MySQL, Amazon DynamoDB 
            and the list continues. Redis, Varnish, and Memcached are famous caching mechanisms.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic Design Ability</h3>
        <p>
            For any technology to get fame it is indeed necessary to have a good user interface along with user experience. 
            Thus, a Full Stack Web developer must have the knowledge of both UI and UX to give out the required output.
        </p>
        <h3>Version Control System</h3>
        <p>VCS is nothing but makes the developer keep a record of the changes that are made in the codebase recently.
            If the developer has enough knowledge of Git then it is extremely useful in understanding the process to 
            fetch the current code along with updating the codes followed by modifying other's codes.</p>
        <ul><li><h4>Git, GitHub SourceTree</h4>
        <p>Git is nothing but an open-source repository based on the web that helps in the productive management of the variations 
        made to the codes, documents, applications and also some of the information related to the development of application.</p></li></ul>
        <h3>HTTP & REST</h3>
        <p>Now, the question arises of what's the functionality of HTTP, it just establishes the communication 
            between the server and client. REST is nothing but a lightweight replacement for RPC for the designing 
            of networked applications.</p>
            <p>REST API acts as a translator medium for Backend to know the Frontend. Hence, making it necessary for 
                the developer to learn the difference along with its functionality.</p>

      <article>
        For a Full Stack Web Development professional it is vital to have good knowledge in backend languages. 
        As it is expected from a Full Stack Web developer by the employers.
        <h3>
            PHP
        </h3>
  
        <p>
            PHP is an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor is one of the popularly used programming languages in the IT sector.
        </p>
        <p>
            It aids the developers in the creation of dynamic content for the interaction with the database and mainly deployed 
            for the development of software applications that are web-based.
        </p>
        <ul><li><pre><code>
            &lt;!--This is a PHP example--&gt;
            
            &lt;?php
            echo "My first PHP script!";
            ?&gt;
           </code></pre></li></ul>

        <h3>
            Python
        </h3>
        <p>
            Python is among the top programming languages used by organizations around the globe due to its simple 
            syntax with huge frameworks namely Flask, Django and many more. 
        </p>
      <ul><li>  <pre><code> 
        #This is a print statment in Python
            print("Hello, World!")
        </code></pre></li></ul>

        <h3>Database Web Storage</h3>
        <p>There comes a necessity of storing the data during the process of developing web pages for future accessibility.
            At times this demands for a developer with knowledge in memory storage and relational database. Hence, get thorough 
            knowledge in this stuff to mark your stability in the organization.</p>
        <p>In addition, it is expected from a developed to understand the difference between relational and non-relational database 
            and XML/ JON knowledge. It is necessary for a new web storage facility for storing the upcoming data in the process 
            of developing websites or applications. Hence, to be a good developer you must grab the theory over relational database 
            along with memory storage.</p>
        <h3>Web Architecture</h3>
        <p>If gaining knowledge over all the above skills and you miss web architecture, then it won't complete your profile as a 
            Full Stack developer. As both frontend and backend are equally important.</p>
            <p>It must be looking easy when creating a simple web application but for the development of any complex structure knowledge 
                of coding structure along with the separation of files for the computation of different tasks.</p>
